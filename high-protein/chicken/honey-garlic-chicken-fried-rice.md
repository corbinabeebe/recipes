### **🧑‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Marinate Chicken:** In a bowl, toss the diced raw chicken breast with the onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, and 35ml of soy sauce.
2.  **Prepare Sauce:** In a separate bowl, mix all Honey Garlic Sauce ingredients: honey, 50ml soy sauce, diced garlic, reduced sugar ketchup, and rice wine vinegar.
3.  **Cook Chicken:** Cook the seasoned chicken in a pan or wok until fully cooked and slightly golden. Remove from the pan and set aside.
4.  **Thicken Sauce:** Add the Honey Garlic Sauce mixture to the pan. Bring to a low simmer and stir in the cornflour slurry (cornflour mixed with water). Stir continuously until the sauce thickens to a glaze consistency.
5.  **Glaze Chicken:** Return the cooked chicken to the pan with the thickened glaze. Toss until every piece is fully coated. Remove the glazed chicken and set it aside.
6.  **Cook Fried Rice:** Use the same pan (add a little oil if needed). Add the eggs and egg whites, scramble, and then add the spring onion (white part). Add the day-old cooked white rice and break it up.
7.  **Add Flavor:** Pour 35ml of soy sauce and the frozen mixed vegetables into the rice. Toss and cook until the vegetables are tender.
8.  **Combine & Finish:** Stir in the glazed chicken, sesame oil, and spring onion (green part). Toss everything together to combine.
9.  **Meal Prep:** **Divide the entire meal into 4 equal servings** and enjoy! ❤️
