### **🧑‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions**

1.  **Season the Chicken:** Place the cubed chicken breast in a bowl. Add the garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and salt. Mix thoroughly.
2.  **Coat the Chicken:** Add the **30g of cornflour** to the seasoned chicken. Ensure the chicken pieces are **well-coated**.
    > *Note: You can skip the cornflour entirely if you do not have it.*
3.  **Cook the Chicken:** Cook the coated chicken in a hot pan (using a touch of oil or cooking spray) until it is cooked through and crispy on the outside.
4.  **Make the Glaze (IMPORTANT):**
    * In a separate bowl, combine all glaze ingredients: the soy sauce/water mixture, honey, and Gochujang paste.
    * Pour the glaze into a clean pan on **low heat**. **Keep stirring constantly** until the sauce starts to bubble lightly.
    * Allow the sauce to **reduce and thicken for 3-4 minutes**.
5.  **Glaze the Chicken:** Add the crispy chicken pieces to the thickened glaze. Toss gently to ensure every piece is thoroughly coated in the sticky sauce.
6.  **Prepare Cucumbers:** If making the pickled cucumbers, mix all cucumber ingredients together in a separate bowl.
7.  **Serve & Meal Prep:** Serve the Sticky Korean Fried Chicken over hot rice.

### **📌 Important Notes for Meal Prep**

* **Cucumbers:** It is best to **store the pickled cucumbers separately** and serve them cold. Do not warm them up with the rest of the meal prep.
* **Glaze:** Be sure to cook the glaze on low heat and stir continuously to prevent burning and ensure proper thickening.
