🧑‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions
Season the Chicken: Slice your chicken into cubes. In a bowl, add the cubed chicken, fresh garlic, chili lime seasoning mix, a squeeze of honey, lime juice, and fresh coriander. Mix well until the chicken is thoroughly coated and the color changes.

Prepare the Spicy Sauce: Combine the sauce ingredients (yogurt, light mayo, hot sauce, honey, chili powder, garlic, and lime juice) in a blender and blend until completely smooth and creamy.

Note: This sauce can be bottled and stored in the fridge for future use.

Cook the Chicken: Heat a pan on the stove and add light butter. Cook the seasoned chicken for approximately 6 minutes, flipping halfway, until it is golden and crispy.

Glaze the Chicken: Lower the heat, add a little more light butter and a drizzle of honey to the pan. Mix the chicken to coat it in the honey butter glaze.

Serve: Serve the glazed chicken over hot rice. Garnish with creamy avocado slices and drizzle with the spicy sauce from Step 2.
